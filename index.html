				I am Afsana Mim and I am a <span class="typing-2"></span>
			</div>
			<p>I work in a company as a web developer, and at the same time, I teach many students. The teaching profession 
is my hobby, and web development is my passion. I have 2 years of experience in full-stack development. 

<br><br>After graduating in 2019, I worked as a Web Developer for Race Online Ltd and Mamun Biriany House (present).
My job's leading roles and responsibilities are designing and developing the front-end (with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap),
back-end with JavaScript, AJAX, PHP, and Database (with MySQL). I have done 6 months of Internship and Training at Pencilbox Training
Institute as a 'Full Stack Developer', where I have gained Industrial and practical knowledge. For my final year project, I 
created a website whose design and functionality were all built from Core PHP using Java, JavaScript, PHP, Ajax, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, 
and MySQL called The Fundraising Management System. During my undergraduate programs, I have done many projects such as the Tic Toe game,
Chatting Apps like Messenger, Rain alarm, CV making website, and a university website (for practice). These projects helped me enhance 
my practical skills, which are crucial to working in the real world. 
I had given numerous presentations and demonstrations about my assignments to department heads and respective teachers, 
whose feedback was always cheerful and appreciative. 
I am highly motivated and proactive at learning new skills and experiencing new things.</p>

				<h4>A Professional Responsive Inventory Management System</h4>
				<p>In essence, I created this website for a reputable national business in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, 
					Java, Javascript, Ajax, and PHP to create this website. Mysql is the database system I've used.</p>
				<details>
  <summary style="color: white;border-radius: 20px;border: 1px solid white">Learn More</summary>
				<p>Software known as an inventory management system is useful for companies that run 
				hardware stores, as it allows the store owner to keep track of purchases and sales.

Customers who are dissatisfied, too much cash sitting in warehouses, and slower sales are all results of poorly managed inventory. 
				This inventory management system can keep track of sales and available stock and
				advise a store owner on how much to buy and when to place a new order.
		A Windows application called Inventory Management System was created specifically for inventory control and produces 
				all of the necessary reports for Windows operating systems.<br>
				This web-based software provides the owner with a plethora of features, including:
1. Maintain a record of every supplier who provides the goods (data editing, data deletion, and computation of the total pay amount). 
2. Play a crucial part in maintaining the records of every employee in this organization (there are currently over 200 employees). Additionally, it generates a salary sheet automatically each month that includes the attendance and salary record.
3. It keeps track of every product in stock and alerts the owner in red.
4. It features an invoice system that captures all client data and allows the owner to examine and print customer history at any time. 
Additionally, the owner is free to read, edit, delete, and download history whenever he pleases.

				<h4>Fundraising Management System</h4>
				<p>With the help of my final-year thesis project, I was able to effectively defend my defense.
					Although I received a really good grade from my supervisor, who was also quite pleased with me, 
					he was quite tough. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Java, 
					Javscript, Ajax, and PHP to build this website (using Core PHP). I've been using MySQL for the database.</p>

	<p>This project provides a broad overview of the work done in the development and deployment of the web-based fundraising administration system.
	This non-profit organizational framework for charity administration allows donors and non-governmental 
	organizations to come in and request and provide money and supplies, such as clothing and medical equipment. 
	These goals include developing an online payment system, establishing a login and registration page, scheduling appointments, 
	enabling users to cancel appointments, and even providing access to the fundraising and other donation systems. 
	The project's design was then created using data flow diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, and diagrams written 
	in the Unified Modeling Language to show how these goals would be achieved.</p>

				<p>My primary focus in this project was on the back end, where I added, 
					removed, and implemented authentication management.
				I utilized HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front end.</p>
